        In North Korea the art is heavily controlled by the government, it is often used as a way to express nationalism, it is often somewhat communistic.
        The food in North Korea is quite similar to South Korean food, however there is less focus on spices and cold noodles are used more often to support the dish. In Pyongyang you can expect to find more meat, bean and pea dishes. 
        Kimchi is one of the most popular foods you can find in North Korea, how kimchi is made varies but one of the most common combinations is vegetables, cabbage, garlic, ginger and fish sauce. It’s served with most dishes in North Korea and it’s used as both a side dish on its own and a compliment to other dishes. 
        In some parts of the country, people are woken up to music. It is usually somewhat nationalistic. The music is used to promote the leaders of the country.
