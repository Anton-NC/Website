            <p>Mangyongdae funfair is an attraction in pyongyang and opened april 1982 It is still open and operational but it has low repairs and looks rundown. The funfair can be packed or deserted because the location is at the edge of the city.  Mangyondgae funfair features a roller coaster and a merry go round. The park received some criticism from Kim-Jong-Un in 2012 which made the park close for a moment so they could repair the attraction.</p>
